# ☕ Coffee Sales Analysis (Excel Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory sales analysis of a coffee shop dataset using **Microsoft Excel**.  
The goal is to extract business insights from transactional data through **data cleaning, pivot tables, KPIs, and visualizations**.

The analysis focuses on understanding **sales performance over time**, **customer behavior**, and **product performance**.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Coffee Sales Dataset)
- Files:
  - `index_1.csv`
  - `index_2.csv`
- Records include:
  - Date and hour of transaction
  - Product sold
  - Payment method (cash / card)
  - Final transaction amount

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Data preparation was performed directly in Excel and includes:
- Converting date and time fields to proper formats
- Standardizing numeric values (amounts)
- Handling empty or inconsistent values
- Creating helper columns for analysis (hour extraction)

Cleaned data is stored in structured Excel tables to support pivot analysis.

## 📊 KPIs
The following general KPIs were calculated:
- **Total Sales**
- **Number of Transactions**
- **Average Sale Value**

These KPIs provide a high-level overview of overall business performance.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Sales by Day
- Daily transaction count
- Daily total revenue
- Identification of highest and lowest revenue days
- Relationship between transaction volume and daily revenue

### 2️⃣ Sales by Hour
- Transaction volume by hour
- Revenue distribution across hours
- Identification of peak hours
- Comparison between average ticket size and total revenue per hour

### 3️⃣ Sales by Product
- Total units sold per product
- Total revenue per product
- Average price per product
- Differentiation between:
  - **Core products** (high volume, high revenue)
  - **Premium/specialty products** (lower volume, higher average price)

### 4️⃣ Product × Hour Analysis
- Product performance during peak hours
- Identification of products that drive revenue during high-traffic periods

### 5️⃣ Payment Method Overview
- Approximate comparison between cash and card usage
- Used as contextual information rather than a key business driver

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes:
- Column charts for sales by day and hour
- Bar charts for product performance
- Comparative visualizations combining volume and revenue

All charts were created directly from Excel pivot tables.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Higher daily revenue is generally associated with higher transaction volume.
- Peak hours concentrate both higher sales volume and higher revenue.
- A small group of core products accounts for most transactions and revenue.
- Premium products contribute meaningfully through higher average prices, even with lower sales volume.
- Revenue generation is balanced between core and premium products rather than dominated by only one group.
